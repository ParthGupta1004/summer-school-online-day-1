    <p>I'm a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in full-stack web development
        and problem-solving. I've built hands-on projects like an online bookstore using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, 
        and MySQL, focusing on real-world features such as user authentication, admin control, and dynamic content management.
        <br/><br/>
        I enjoy learning how systems work end-to-end — from database design to responsive UI — and I'm continuously improving my DSA and core 
        CS concepts to prepare for impactful roles in tech.
        <br/><br/>
        In my free time, I enjoy pursuing my hobbies which include playing cricket and listening to music. 
        Cricket keeps me active and teaches me teamwork, strategy, and discipline. On the other hand, music is my escape—it helps me relax, boosts my mood, and fuels my creativity. Together, these hobbies bring balance to my life and keep me energized.
